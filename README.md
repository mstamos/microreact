# Meteor + React + FlowRouter + ES6

I wanted to learn React with Meteor by building something. So I decide to
rebuild [Microscope] (https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope), the app with which I learned Meteor.
[Microscope] (https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope) is an app which someone can build it by reading the [Discover Meteor Book] (http://www.discovermeteor.com).
In this version I rebuilt the app until chapter 10-5 and you can find a dome [here](http://microreact.meteor.com). You can find a dome at [Microreact](http://microreact.meteor.com/)

The packages I use are:

1. [react] (https://github.com/meteor/react-packages) (It is not officially announced by MDG yet)
2. [meteorhacks:flow-router] (https://atmospherejs.com/meteorhacks/flow-router)
3. [twbs:bootstrap](https://atmospherejs.com/twbs/bootstrap)
4. [accounts-password](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/accounts-password)
5. [xolvio:cucumber](https://atmospherejs.com/xolvio/cucumber


This repo doesn't officially supported by [Discover Meteor](http://www.discovermeteor.com).
