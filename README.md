# Microscope + React + FlowRouter + Tests = Microreact

I wanted to learn React with Meteor by building something. So I decided to
rebuild [Microscope] (https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope), the app with which I learned Meteor.
[Microscope] (https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope) is an app that someone can build by reading the [Discover Meteor Book] (http://www.discovermeteor.com).
In this version I rebuilt the app until chapter 10-5 and you can find a dome [here](http://microreact.meteor.com). You can find a dome at [Microreact](http://microreact.meteor.com/).

Except from integrating React and Meteor I wanted to learn how to write tests for my applications. So in this repo you will find 60 tests, 13 unit tests, 6 integration and 41 end-to-end. 
I used [xolvio:cucumber] (https://atmospherejs.com/xolvio/cucumber) for end-to-end tests and [sanjo:jasmine](https://atmospherejs.com/sanjo/jasmine) for integration and unit tests. I tried to explain every line
 of code into my tests.

If you want to run the app download the repo
  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mstamos/microreact.git
```

```
$ cd microreact
```

If you want to run only integration and unit test just run meteor into command line and you will see the green dot from velocity
on right-top corner

```
$ meteor
```

If you want to run the end-to-end test you can do it by typing and enjoy the view from new browser!

```
$ CUCUMBER_TAGS=@rerun meteor
```


Below you will find all the resources I used to learn writing tests.

Feel free to open a new issue if you find any mistakes or you want further explanations or you want to suggest something else.
I am quite new on React and Testing so I tried to do my best.
